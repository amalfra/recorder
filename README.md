A go package to capture stdout and stderr generated by your code

## Installation
You can download the package using
```sh
go get github.com/amalfra/recorder/v3
```
## Usage
Next, import the package
``` go
import (
  "github.com/amalfra/recorder/v3"
)
```
You can record output from both Stdout as well as Stderr. The recorded output will be available as string. The following two structs are available for your use:
* recorder.Stdout - Can be used for recording from Stdout
* recorder.Stderr - Can be used for recording from Stderr

There are four struct methods which can be used to control recording process:
* Start - To start recording
* Stop - To stop recording
* GetOutput - To return recorded output as string
* ClearOutput - To clear the recorded output

To record follow below steps:

1. first create the instance of struct as follows:
```go
rec := new(recorder.Stdout)
```
or if to record from Stderr do
```go
rec := new(recorder.Stderr)
```

2. Now call the ```Start``` method as follows:
```go
rec.Start()
```
From now onwards all Stdout or Stderr output will be captured.

3. Call ```Stop``` method as follows when you want to stop recording process:
```go
rec.Stop()
```

4. Now get the recorded output by calling the ```GetOutput``` method. It will return the recorded output string
```go
out := rec.GetOutput()
```
